            <h3>Graduated HighSchool |  Restaurant Supervisor </h3>
            <p>
                Throughout high school, I adeptly balanced academics with extracurriculars like wrestling, robotics, and software development, maintaining a commendable 3.5 GPA. Alongside my scholastic achievements, I honed leadership skills as a restaurant supervisor, nurturing my passion for bodybuilding in my spare time.</p>

            <h3>Enrolled in College | Personal Trainer </h3>

            
            <p>At 18, I bought my first apartment for me and my at the time girlfriend, (now wife). Transitioning from a restaurant supervisor to a personal trainer let me serve my community and create the flexbility needed for college. At Southern University, I double-majored in Mechanical Engineering and Software. In my freshman year, I interned with Proctor and Gamble as a ME, saving the company $2 million annually.</p>

            <h3>Finishing Bachelors | Personal Training Manager</h3>
            <p> In early 2024, I received a job offer that prompted me to move my family to Georgia. I enrolled at Georgia State University as a Computer Science major, which slightly pushed back my graduation date. Despite life's ups and downs, including my new role as a personal training manager, I remain committed to my goals of skill improvement and becoming a successful software developer.</p>

            <p>
                I anticipate completing my bachelor's in CS by early 2027. Throughout my college journey, I aim to secure an internship with a company that shares my values. Ideally, I seek a company culture that provides challanges to grow my skill set and offers long-term growth opportunities. Following graduation, my plan is to transition into a full-time role with the company where I completed my internship / internships.</p>

            <h3>Pursue Masters | Secure Rental Property </h3>

            
            <p>After earning my bachelor's degree, I intend to immediately pursue a master's program in CS while also pursuing a bachelor's in real estate. Upon completing both degrees, I aim to utilize them to acquire real estate for my family and support my peers and colleagues in their CS endeavors by sharing the knowledge I've gained. </p>

            <h3>Pursue PHD | Postively Impact Others</h3>
            <p> 
                By 2030, at the ripe "old" age of 27, I will have accomplished what I've set out to do. Once I've completed my PhD in CS, I will use my knowledge and funds to provide Scholarships and guidance for  individuals who are driven. I choose to walk a hard path to cultivate a postive and successfull enviroment as well as help the needy. My story will inspire others, showing you can do whatever you put your mind to!  <p>
